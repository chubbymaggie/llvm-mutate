** TODO populated inserted instruction arguments from scope
When inserting an instruction we need to
1. give it arguments from the current scope
2. assign its result into something in the current scope

pointers which may be useful

- RemapInstruction
  : /// RemapInstruction - Convert the instruction operands from referencing the
  : /// current values into those specified by VMap.
  : static inline void RemapInstruction(Instruction *I, ValueToValueMapTy &VMap)

  this is used a couple of places =RemapInstruction=, read its documentation

- get arguments from nearby instructions
  : ->getOperand(0)

- set operand to something specific
  : Clone->setArgOperand(0, Op);

- add input operands to an instruction
  : // Insert new integer induction variable.
  : PHINode *NewPHI = PHINode::Create(Int32Ty, 2, PN->getName()+".int", PN);
  : NewPHI->addIncoming(ConstantInt::get(Int32Ty, InitValue),
  :                     PN->getIncomingBlock(IncomingEdge));

** TODO swap is really just two replaces, for a replace we need to
we only really need to

1. replace everything using the original with the new
   : orig->replaceAllUsesWith(new)

2. replace all arguments of the new with arguments of the original
   (or appropriate arguments selected from the environment)
   : user->op_iterator()

* Notes
** use-def and def-use
file:../../../docs/ProgrammersManual.html
see Iterating over def-use & use-def chains


** similarly read more about the value class and use user iterators
